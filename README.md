Go Army (Java Swing, DB4O object database)

Go Army application is to connect distanced army troops to healthcare, educational and housing organizations.

The organization’s admins could approve / reject the requests in their specific work requests.

Problem Statement : 
What does it mean to leave the Armed Forces?
Relocating, living independently for the first time
● No access to adequate mental healthcare
● No access to adequate Higher Education
● These major life changes are challenging for military people, just as they are challenging for anyone.
● The challenges associated with these changes are not easily studied or represented, in part because they are not captured by medical diagnoses, and in part because it is difficult to draw meaningful lines between physiological, psychological, and social problems.
● Moreover, this stuff of everyday life tends to be overshadowed by veterans’ other, more extreme, experiences in combat.

So, what can we do to help this situation?
Develop, design and deploy a multi-party organization that can connect the troop to one or more organizations
● Incorporate Medical, Education, Employment & Housing Enterprises. Multiple organizations under the said enterprises under which the troop can apply for training, seek medical help etc.
● Organizational users can review applications/requests and approve/reject the same - or if required route them to other organizations under a different enterprise.
